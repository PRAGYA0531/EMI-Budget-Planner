  How to Run
•  Install Python 
•  Run the GUI:
      -emi_gui.py

EMI Formula
EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N – 1]

   Code Details
•The project uses Python to calculate EMI based on user inputs like emi amount, interest rate, and tenure.
•A GUI built with Tkinter collects inputs and displays EMI results in a clean, simple interface.
•The code is organized into separate files to keep calculations and GUI logic easy to manage and understand.
